It’s Never your last chance.  Not your last bitch, not your last business opportunity Ur never out of the game if ur a man

Everytime you thought ur life was over it X Condition didn’t work out you were wrong https://t.co/efNWRlrXn5 

Fiction far superior to non fiction

More realistic too ironically.  Gotta have a wide array of personal experience to infuse a fictional character with esprit &amp; éclat

More breadth in fiction https://t.co/AVK5q5IazQ

Very dumb to take any misfortune that comes your way at face value 

9 times out of 10 it forces you to behave in ways you wouldn’t have before &amp; you end up salvaging &amp; getting a better outcome than you would have had before 

Basically misfortune is a way to leverage ur winning traits that stay dormant when shits going smooth
