The whole world is collapsing thing is a psychosexual projection

No shit you think the world is ending if you get zero pussy and are dirt poor

Plenty of people roaming around completely uninhibited by the chicanery of the elites cause they have their affairs in order

The upside to working thru grave loss early in life, blown up portfolios, fallen trysts etc is you get ur pain circuitry ripped out at a certain threshold

Desensitized to pain at a point its impossible to get heartsick anymore

Then others can lean heavy on your strength

Very dumb to take any misfortune that comes your way at face value 

9 times out of 10 it forces you to behave in ways you wouldn’t have before &amp; you end up salvaging &amp; getting a better outcome than you would have had before

Fiction far superior to non fiction

More realistic too ironically.  Gotta have a wide array of personal experience to infuse a fictional character with esprit &amp; éclat

More breadth in fiction https://t.co/AVK5q5IazQ_T_TWEET_T_1593733104144785408_T_TEXT_T_RT @brutedeforce: U hate cocky men Bc they aren’t easily manipulated into ur world view

_T_TWEET_T_1593745393501712385_T_TEXT_T_There’s a brand of masochism where guys will take attempts at things they know they have 0% chance of achieving

Get rejected on purpose, lose on purpose cause there’s safety in guaranteed failure 

Actual courage is becoming the kinda person who could actually achieve it

_T_TWEET_T_1593984098774630402_T_TEXT_T_The reason people never try in general is very simple.  They’re afraid of their life turning into a tragicomedy where everyone is in on the joke that they’re never gonna make it despise their best efforts.  People don’t recover from just a sliver of that  kinda embarrassment https://t.co/hA1yOJ6LZO
